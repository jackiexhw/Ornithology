### Ornithology
##### This project compiles relevant information about birds from the National Audubon Bird Guide page. For each bird on the page, it gets the scientific name, family, habitat, feeding behavior, eggs/youth, diet, and nesting. All of this is organized into a csv file that can be turned into an excel sheet for easier viewing. This was created to gather all of this information to one location.

#### To run this program, download Jupyter and ChromeDriver
1. download [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

#### To put the information from the csv file onto an excel spreadsheet so it's easier to read:
* visit this [link](https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/6269-convert-a-text-file-to-an-excel-file?lang=en_US) for an in-depth description on how to convert onto spreadsheet.

#### Note:
##### Because we are visiting the page for each individual bird and gathering all the information from each page, running the program until completion could take up to an hour.
