### Ornithology
##### This project compiles relevant information about birds from the National Audubon Bird Guide page. For each bird on the page, it gets the scientific name, family, habitat, feeding behavior, eggs/youth, diet, and nesting. All of this is organized into a csv file that can be turned into an excel sheet for easier viewing. This was originally created to gather all of this information to one location for a Science Olympiad event.

#### Files in this repository
1. Birbs.py - original program, needs Python downloaded on device to run
2. Birds Spreadsheet.xlsx - final product of the program organized into an excel spreadsheet
3. Ornithology.exe - executable version of birbs.py that can be run without downloading python
4. README.md - this file
5. birds'csv - recommend opening this in notepad. Initial product of the program without exporting it to excel.
6. chromedriver.exe - need to download in order to run both the executable and the original program

#### To run this program:
* Select the "Clone or Download" button and then select "Download ZIP" to download the repository (this will also download the final product)
* Extract all the files
* Run the file titled "Ornithology"
* It may take a little while to start running but the program will output periodic updates regarding how close to completion it is
* Once the program is done, the csv file can be viewed through the Notepad app. To put the information from the csv file onto an excel spreadsheet so it's easier to read, visit this [link](https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/6269-convert-a-text-file-to-an-excel-file?lang=en_US) for an in-depth description.

#### To view the final result of the program:
* (recommended) click on Birds Spreadsheet.xlsx and then select "view raw". This will download the spreadsheet onto the device. Open the file from there.
OR
* click on birds'csv and then select "view raw". This will open the slightly unorganized version in the browser.

#### Note:
##### Because we are visiting the page for each individual bird and gathering all the information from each page, running the program until completion could take up to an hour.
